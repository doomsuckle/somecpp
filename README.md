# somecpp

some notes and call-outs

- program assumes items should flow
- did not add much in the way of testing here and test packaging
- no explicit checks on json
- used a very simply make file to include what's in the include path. Didn't spend time to do the object linking et al. 

note on the g++ compiler:

This was done with a Mac. Some time ago, macs moved to using "clang." There's still a g++ compiler, but it actually uses clang under the covers.
